# react-puzzle

## Purpose
This little project was a fun way for me to learn `react-dnd`, CSS grids, redux middleware, and practice other concepts.  I've also wanted to try clipping an image into several pieces for a long time now, so this was the perfect opportunity to learn.

The theme of the puzzle is currently hardcoded to be my mentor [Jeremy Lund](https://github.com/lund0n).
